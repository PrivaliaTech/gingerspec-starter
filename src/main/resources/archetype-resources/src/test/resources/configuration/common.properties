# ********************************* GLOBAL PROPERTIES ************************************************
#
# This file contains environment-independent properties that can be used in the scenarios steps using
# the #{} placeholder
#
# Environment-specific configuration can be located in a separated file. This configuration can
# override the configuration from the common file. All environment specific configuration files
# can be included at runtime via maven variable, setting the 'env' to the name of the file.
#
# for example, to use properties from the file uat.properties located in
# /resources/configuration/uat.properties, just pass -Denv=uat when
# running your tests
