# ********************************* COMMON PROPERTIES ************************************************
# This file is used to store variables that you can use directly in your Scenarios and Steps. For this
# you will have to use ${envProperties:my.key}. For example, the following step:
#
#       Given I put some '${envProperties:spice.name}' in my soup
#
# Will be transformed to:
#
#       Given I put some 'ginger' in my soup
#
# For using the variables in the other files, you have to use -Denv=<filename> when running your test,
# for example:
#
# mvn verify -Denv=int      -> uses the variables from int.properties file
# mvn verify -Denv=uat      -> uses the variables from uat.properties file
# mvn verify -Denv=pro      -> you got the idea, right?
#
# Ideally, this is used to store variables that can change depending on an environment (like urls,
# user credentials, IP addresses, etc). If -Denv is not detected, the values from this file will be
# used by default
